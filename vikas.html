		<h3>What is <strong>HTML ?</strong></b></body></h3>
		<strong>HTML</strong>&nbsp determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive. So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.
				In this case, I like to break down the three technologies – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – this way: they are like a human body.
			<ol>1.HTML is the skeleton,</ol>
				<ul>2.CSS is the skin,</ul>
				and JavaScript is the circulatory, digestive, and respiratory systems that brings the structure and the skin to life.
				You can also look at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript this way: HTML is the structure of a house, CSS is the interior and exterior decor, and JavaScript is the electricity, water system, and many other functional features that make the house livable.

	<ol>To understand "HTML" from front to back, let's look at each word that makes up the abbreviation:

		<strong><ol>Hypertext: </strong>text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items.</ol>
		<strong><ol>Markup:</strong> a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format.</ol>

		<strong><ul>Language:</strong> a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands.</ol>

		HTML Tags&nbsp;
		Since HTML defines the markup for a particular web page, you'll want the text, images, or other embeds to appear in certain ways.
		
		<strong>For example,</strong>&nbsp; you might want some text to be big, other text to be small, and some to be bold, italic, or in bullet point form.
		
		HTML has "tags" that let you get this done. So, there are tags to create headings, paragraphs, bolded words, italicized words, and more.
